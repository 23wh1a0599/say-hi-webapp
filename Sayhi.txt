This HTML and JavaScript program creates a simple interactive webpage that greets the user by name. The page includes a heading, a text input field labeled "Enter Your Name", and a button that says "Say Hi". When the user enters their name and clicks the button, the sayHi() function is triggered. This function retrieves the value from the input field using document.getElementById("userName").value. If the input field is empty (i.e., the user hasn't entered a name), it sets the text of the paragraph with ID para1 to "Enter Your Name!!!" and changes its color to red to indicate an error or missing input. If a name is entered, it displays a personalized greeting like "Hi xyz !" and changes the text color to green to indicate success. This demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, user input handling, and conditional logic using JavaScript.
